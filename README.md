Hamiltonian Path Problem
========================

  In the mathematical field of graph theory a Eulerian path is a trail in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similary
  an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian Cycle is an Eulerian trail which starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed
  by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem in 1736.

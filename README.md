Hamiltonian Path Problem
========================

  In the mathematical field of graph theory the Hamiltonian path problem and the Hamiltonian cycle problem are problems of
  determining whether a Hamiltonian path (a path in an undirected or directed that visits each vertex exactly once) or a 
  Hamiltonian cycle exists in a given graph (directed or undirected);
